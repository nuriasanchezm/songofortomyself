  <h1>about</h1>

<p>
  Have you ever encountered a poem, song, or quote, that resonated profoundly with you, only to find out later on
  that it is a forgery, and that the original version is actually terrible? 
  That happened to me as an undergraduate, when I first read  <a href="https://trianarts.com/walt-whitman-nace-el-31-de-mayo-en-long-island-ny/#sthash.WX1ywIsS.dpbs">León Felipe's Spanish translation</a> (which he called, actually, <em>paráfrasis</em>) of <a href="https://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/whitman/1855.html"><em>Song of Myself</em></a>
  by Walt Whitman (United States of America, 1819-92), in a hardcover book as heavy as my heart at that moment.
  The last stanza of the last part stroke me as the most romantic literary piece I had ever read. But when I looked
  it up on the Internet to learn more about it, I found two things: another <a href="https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Whitman,%20Walt%20-%20Hojas%20De%20Hierbas.Pdf">Spanish translation</a> that butchered both
  the form and meaning I was fascinated by, and Whitman's original... which was, sadly, exactly as bad.
</p>
  In this short project I aim to reconcile the three versions to determine what is gained and what is lost in the passage
  between English and Spanish, and I will provide further proof on why León Felipe's version excels, based on Jorge
  Luis Borges's critique of the text (his <a href="https://hispanicla.com/walt-whitman-canto-a-mi-mismo-prologo-y-traduccion-de-jorge-luis-borges-61190 ">translation</a> can be found online, but it is not complete).
